# Project Name
Machine test

## What it does
It fetches sales data from an endpoint then stores into a local sqlite database

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start server:
   npm start

## Working 
Basically it has two routes
 - One for fetching from endpoint
 - One for reading from local Db
So after running npm start just go to http://localhost:3000 
 - add /api and refresh the browser for fetching
 - do the same with /local for reading data from db
You can delete sales_db if you want, it will be generated when we go to /api route
